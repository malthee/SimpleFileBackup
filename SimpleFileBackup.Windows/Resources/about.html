        <h1>Simple File Backup Windows</h1>
        Program by Marcel Salvenmoser
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>General</h3>
        Select files or folders by pressing the Select buttons on the right. You can select multiple files or folders at once.
        After pressing OK the file locations will be saved in the drop down list. You can also add files by typing the path in the textbox and pressing enter. If you made a wrong selection, you can delete single items by selecting them in the drop down list and pressing "Delete Item".
        You can clear the list by pressing "Clear List".
        <br>
        <br>
        Backup Destinations can be selected through the same process. Every file or folder in "Files to Backup" will be backed up to every "Backup Destination".
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Settings</h3>
        <b>Override idenetical files in directory</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        If you want to replace your old files with the new files enable the "Override identical files in directory" option.
        This way, if a file called 123.jpg is already in the directory, it will be replaced. Same goes for ZIP files.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Put files in given directory</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        Copies the files and folders into the selected directories.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Create a subfolder in directory</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        Creates a subfolder in every given directory with the provided name.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Create a .zip file in directory</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        Create a .zip with the provided name from the given files and folders and copy it to every listed directory.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Name Folder/.zip</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        Only works when "Create a subfolder in directory" or "Create a .zip file in directory" is selected.
        <br>
        You can name your folder or .zip file with a maximum of 20 characters. The characters have to be compatible with the windows filesystem.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Add date to Folder/.zip name</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        Adds your local date to the folder/.zip name in the format name_10-10-2010.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Save Defaults</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        Saves your file/backup locations and settings to keep them for the next program start.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Save Custom File Paths & Save Custom Backup Paths</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        Saves your file/backup locations in a text file you can choose the location of.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Open File Paths & Open Backup Paths</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        You can open a text file that contains paths to files or directories. These paths will be inserted into the drop down list.

        This is my first publicly released program. I made it because I needed a tool to backup files to more locations at once and I wanted to code something in my summer holidays. I do not expect much from this program but any feedback or criticism is appreciated.
